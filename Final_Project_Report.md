# Final Project Report

## Abstract and Introduction
This notebook implements a pipeline for natural language processing (NLP) and data analysis using popular Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, and `spacy`. The primary goal is to preprocess textual data, utilize GPU acceleration where available, and prepare the dataset for further machine learning tasks. This work demonstrates essential steps for text preprocessing and sets the stage for advanced NLP or ML tasks.

## Prior Related Work
This project leverages well-established libraries and methodologies:
- **SpaCy**: A widely-used NLP library for tokenization and text cleaning.
- **PyTorch**: Integrated for potential GPU-accelerated machine learning workflows.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.

The integration of these tools reflects current best practices in NLP and data science.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file located at `/dgxa_home/se22uari173/train.csv`.
- **Operation**: The data is read using Pandas (`pd.read_csv`) and stored as a DataFrame in the variable `df`.
- **Assumptions**: The dataset likely contains textual data for preprocessing. A deeper exploration is necessary to fully understand its structure and content.

## Methodology / Model
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Function**: `preprocess_text(text)`
   - **Logic**:
     - Utilizes SpaCy to parse input text.
     - Removes punctuation and whitespace.
     - Joins cleaned tokens into a single string.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures text is clean and prepared for NLP tasks such as embedding generation or sentiment analysis.
2. **Device Configuration**:
   - Detects GPU availability using PyTorch.
   - Defaults to CPU for computations if GPU is unavailable.

## Experiments
- **Preprocessing Validation**:
  - Text data from the dataset is processed through the `preprocess_text` function to verify proper tokenization and cleaning.
- **Device Verification**:
  - Confirms the runtime environment (CUDA or CPU) to ensure hardware optimization.

## Results
- **Processed Text**: Cleaned and tokenized text ready for further NLP tasks.
- **Device Status**: Confirms whether the computations will run on GPU or CPU, ensuring optimal performance based on the system's hardware.
